# Text-Classification-for-Sexual-Harassment-Detection

This script implements a machine learning pipeline for text classification to detect
different forms of sexual harassment, including commenting, ogling/facial
expressions/staring, and touching/groping. The pipeline includes data preprocessing,
model training, evaluation, and real-time text classification. This script also uses Explainable AI called LIME
for blackbox visualization of important words pertaining to classification.
